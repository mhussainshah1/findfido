# LostPets

### Fido is Missing!
Your job is to create a Spring Boot web application to help find Fido or any other lost pet. Sad owners can post pictures of their missing pet along with the name, date lost and description. We're not sorting by Date so keep it simple and make date a text field. It's easier. You're welcome!

Owners (who must be registered on the website, either through website or pre-populated with a dataloader) can also view a page listing all their posts. From that page they can change the status to "Found!". There is no need to delete the posts.

All users can view all posts.

If you get all those features working then add the ability to Edit a post. Make everything else work FIRST.

Use MySQL, Cloudinary, Bootstrap. GitHub.
